### Problem Statement:

There are five holes arranged in a line. A fox is hiding in one of these holes. Each night, the fox moves to one of the adjacent holes (either left or right). You can inspect one hole each morning. What is the optimal strategy to guarantee you catch the fox in the minimum number of days?

#### Solution Strategy:

The key to solving this puzzle lies in a specific pattern of hole inspections. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Day 1: Inspect hole 3.
Day 2: Inspect hole 2.
Day 3: Inspect hole 4.
Repeat the sequence 2, 3, 4 until you catch the fox.

#### Why This Strategy Works:

Initial Inspection: By checking hole 3 on the first day, you're effectively dividing the possible fox positions into two groups: holes 1-2 and holes 4-5.
Pattern Repetition: The subsequent pattern of checking holes 2, 3, and 4 ensures that regardless of the fox's initial position and subsequent moves, it will eventually be in one of the inspected holes.
Maximum Number of Days:

In the worst-case scenario, it will take a maximum of 6 days to catch the fox. This occurs when the fox starts in hole 1 or 5 and moves optimally to avoid capture.

Divide and Conquer: The initial inspection divides the problem into smaller subproblems.
Cyclic Pattern: The repeated pattern ensures complete coverage of all possible fox positions.
Worst-Case Analysis: Understanding the worst-case scenario helps to determine the maximum number of days required.

## Other solutions for N holes.

For N holes, we can generalize the strategy as follows:

Initial Inspection: Inspect hole number ceil(N/2).
Subsequent Inspections:
If the fox is not caught, inspect holes from hole number 2 to hole number N-1 in sequential order.
If the fox is still not caught, reverse the order and inspect holes from N-1 to 2.
Why This Strategy Works:

Initial Inspection: By inspecting the middle hole, we divide the possible fox locations into two halves.
Sequential Inspections: The subsequent inspections ensure that regardless of the fox's initial position and subsequent moves, it will eventually be in one of the inspected holes.
Reversing the Order: Reversing the inspection order after the first pass ensures that the fox cannot escape to the ends.
Example for N = 7:

Day 1: Inspect hole 4.
Day 2: Inspect hole 2.
Day 3: Inspect hole 3.
Day 4: Inspect hole 4.
Day 5: Inspect hole 5.
Day 6: Inspect hole 4.
Day 7: Inspect hole 3.
