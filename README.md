## Ghosthunter Game

You are a ghosthunter and need to search a haunted house for a ghost. 
There are 5 rooms in the house that could be haunted. 
The ghost can move during the night to an adjecent room. 
You can search during the day when it is safe, and it takes all day to setup and take down all of your paranormal sensing equipment, so you can only search one room at a time.
The goal is to find the ghost as quickly as possible.


#### Inspiration
This game is based on the logic puzzle "Fox in the hole", also inspired by the game "Phasmophobia", a co-op horror game where you and your friends use ghost-hunting equipment to gather evidence of paranormal activity and figure out what is haunting the area. 
The puzzle has a fox and 5 holes. Each night the fox moves to an adjecent hole. During the day you can search one hole. The goal is to find the fox. For this game the ghost replaces the fox and instead of holes its a haunted house with different rooms.
