### Brownie
This is usually a helpful houshold spirit, but now it's avoiding chores. It can move around the house unrestricted. These are usually depicted as small humanoids or elves that live in homes or farms. They are not very popular in modern media, however they are similar to House Elves in Harry Potter, or Keebler evles that make cookies.
